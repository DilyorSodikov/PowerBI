3. **How do you download and install Power BI Desktop?**
   Go to the [Microsoft Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/), download Power BI Desktop, and install it by following the setup wizard. It is also available from the Microsoft Store.

4. **What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service?**

* **Power BI Desktop**: Used locally for data modeling, importing, and designing reports.
* **Power BI Service**: Cloud-based platform used for sharing, collaboration, and scheduled refresh.

5. **What file extension does a Power BI project use?**
   `.pbix`

6. **Explain the role of Power Query in Power BI.**
   Power Query is used for **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)** â€” cleaning, shaping, and preparing data before analysis.

7. **Why would a business prefer Power BI over Excel for reporting?**
   Because Power BI offers interactive dashboards, real-time data refresh, stronger data modeling, and easier sharing/collaboration compared to Excelâ€™s static reports.

8. **Describe one limitation of the free version of Power BI.**
   Reports cannot be shared with others in the free version; sharing requires a Pro license.

9. **What is a "published report" in Power BI Service?**
   A report created in Power BI Desktop and uploaded (published) to the Power BI Service so users can access it online.

10. **How does Power BI Mobile enhance accessibility?**
    It allows users to view and interact with dashboards and reports anytime, anywhere, on iOS and Android devices.

11. **Compare Power BI with Tableauâ€”pros and cons.**

* **Power BI Pros**: Lower cost, strong Microsoft ecosystem integration, easy to use.
* **Power BI Cons**: Slightly weaker advanced visual customization.
* **Tableau Pros**: Very powerful visuals and analytics.
* **Tableau Cons**: Higher cost, steeper learning curve.

12. **Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.**
    Power BI connects with Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse, and other Azure services for secure cloud-based storage, advanced analytics, and machine learning.

13. **What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?**
    A gateway connects on-premises data sources (like SQL Server) to Power BI Service, enabling scheduled refresh and live connections.

* Row-Level Security (RLS)
* Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
* Azure Active Directory integration for authentication
* Sensitivity labels and compliance with GDPR/ISO standards

### **Practical Task (Sales_Data Table)**

| OrderID | Product  | Quantity | Price | OrderDate |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | --------- |
| 1001    | Laptop   | 2        | 1200  | 1/5/2023  |
| 1002    | Mouse    | 5        | 25    | 2/5/2023  |
| 1003    | Keyboard | 1        | 80    | 2/5/2023  |
| 1004    | Monitor  | 1        | 300   | 3/5/2023  |
| 1005    | Laptop   | 1        | 1200  | 3/5/2023  |

#### Add a Calculated Column: **TotalSales = Quantity Ã— Price**

```DAX
TotalSales = Sales_Data[Quantity] * Sales_Data[Price]
```

Resulting Table:

| OrderID | Product  | Quantity | Price | OrderDate | TotalSales |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1001    | Laptop   | 2        | 1200  | 1/5/2023  | 2400       |
| 1002    | Mouse    | 5        | 25    | 2/5/2023  | 125        |
| 1003    | Keyboard | 1        | 80    | 2/5/2023  | 80         |
| 1004    | Monitor  | 1        | 300   | 3/5/2023  | 300        |
| 1005    | Laptop   | 1        | 1200  | 3/5/2023  | 1200       |

#### Measure: **Total Revenue**

```DAX
TotalRevenue = SUM(Sales_Data[TotalSales])
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Total Revenue = 2400 + 125 + 80 + 300 + 1200 = 4105**
